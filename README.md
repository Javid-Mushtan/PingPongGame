# PingPongGame
A simple 2D Ping Pong game implemented in Java using Swing and AWT libraries. This project is a classic two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball and score points.

Features
1.) Two-player gameplay: Player 1 controls the left paddle using W (up) and S (down) keys. Player 2 controls the right paddle using the UP and DOWN arrow keys.

2.) Score tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score and displays it on the screen.

3.) Pause and Continue: The game can be paused when a player wins, and you can choose to continue or terminate the game.

4.) Dynamic ball movement: The ball changes direction when it hits the paddles or the top/bottom walls.

5.) Game Over: When the ball goes out of bounds, the game declares the winner and resets the ball for the next round.

How to Run the Game
Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Running the Game:

Open the project in Eclipse or any Java IDE.

Navigate to the PingPongGame.java file.

Run the main method in the PingPongGame class.

The game window will open, and you can start playing.

Controls
Player 1:

W key: Move paddle up.

S key: Move paddle down.

Player 2:

UP arrow key: Move paddle up.

DOWN arrow key: Move paddle down.

Code Structure
PingPongGame.java: The main class that implements the game logic, graphics, and event handling.

paintComponent(Graphics g): Handles rendering of the game objects (paddles, ball, and scores).

keyPressed(KeyEvent e) and keyReleased(KeyEvent e): Handle keyboard input for paddle movement.

run(): The game loop that updates the ball and paddle positions.

resetBall(): Resets the ball to the center of the screen.

paused(): Handles the pause and continue functionality.

Dependencies
This project uses Java's built-in libraries:

java.awt.* for graphics and event handling.

javax.swing.* for creating the game window and UI components.

Future Improvements
Add a start menu with options for single-player vs. AI or two-player mode.

Implement difficulty levels (e.g., increasing ball speed over time).

Add sound effects for ball hits and scoring.

Improve the UI with animations and better graphics.
